But next to the garage was another shared with a big green door. Also locked. No one even knew who had the key to the lock. That shed wasnâ€™t opened more than once a year when Ma turned out all the old broken bits of furniture and rows of matting and leaking buckets. The times when the white and hills were broken and swept away and filth spread into the spider webs and rat holes. All of this so that the whole operation was like the looting of a poor, ruined and conquered city. The green leaves of the door sacked. They were nearly off their rusty hinges. The hinges were large and made a small gap between the door and the walls-only just large enough for rats, dogs and, possibly, Ravi to slip through and commit the grave crime that he had commmitted.
